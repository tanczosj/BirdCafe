### **2. Quick Start Guide**

The system is designed to "just work" in seconds. You can add tooltips in two ways:

#### **Method 1: Using the Inspector (Recommended for Designers)**

1.  **Add the `TooltipTrigger` Component:**
    Select any UI GameObject and add the `TooltipTrigger` component.

2.  **Add Content:**
    Fill in the fields in the Inspector.

**Done!** The `TooltipManager` is created automatically.

#### **Method 2: Using Code (Recommended for Programmers)**

You can add and customize tooltips entirely from your own scripts with a single static method.

**Example:**
```csharp
// Get a reference to your button's GameObject
public GameObject myButton;

// Add a simple tooltip in one line
TooltipTrigger.AddTooltip(myButton, "This is a procedural tooltip.");

// Or, add a complex tooltip and customize it
var trigger = TooltipTrigger.AddTooltip(myButton, "Stats and info here.", "Magic Sword");
trigger.TitleColor = Color.cyan;
trigger.HoverDelay = 1.0f;
```

*(See the Demo Scene in `Assets/Easy Tooltip/Demo` for live examples of both methods.)*

### **3. Core Components**

*   **`TooltipTrigger`:** The main component you add to your UI elements. It holds the content for a tooltip.
*   **`TooltipManager`:** The "brain" of the system. It handles positioning, input detection, and reparenting logic automatically.
*   **`Tooltip` Prefab:** The visual prefab for the tooltip. You can edit it to change the default fonts, background, etc. It is located in `Assets/Easy Tooltip/Prefabs/`.

### **4. Configuration**

You can configure global settings (Max Width, Fade Speed, etc.) in two ways:

**1. Global Settings (Recommended):**
Edit the **`TooltipManager` prefab** directly. This changes the defaults for your whole project.
Prefab Path: `Assets/Easy Tooltip/Resources/TooltipManager.prefab`

**2. Per-Scene Overrides (Optional):**
Drag the `TooltipManager` prefab into a scene's hierarchy to use different settings for that scene only.

### **5. FAQ & Support**

**Q: Does this work with multiple Canvases or World Space UI?**
A: Yes. The system automatically detects which Canvas the hovered object belongs to and ensures the tooltip is rendered on the correct layer and coordinate space.

**Q: My tooltip's positioning looks off when using a UI Outline.**
A: This is handled automatically. The positioning system detects if the tooltip prefab uses an `Outline` component and adjusts its on-screen clamping to ensure the outline is never cut off.
